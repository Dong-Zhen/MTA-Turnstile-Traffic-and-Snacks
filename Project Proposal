Project Proposal

Objective: Use MTA's public Turnstile Data to help YoLocal Snack expand into communities with stations that New Yorkers enter and exit for long daily commutes. Determine when "rush hours" are to prevent overcrowded shops and to fully meet demands.

Datasets: MTA's Turnstile Data, Dataset that has location of stations Resources Required: Mta train schedule to estimate how long commutes are from stations within Queens or Brooklyn to Manhattan, or a study based on new york city commute time. Domain Knowledge: Learn if fast food sellers near potential stations receive more customers during meal hours, Know Habits of New York Commuter(I have a decade of transit commuting observations), mta person who uploads the mta data
Tools: SQL, Python libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn Algorithms: TBH

Step1: Store datasets into SQL Database Step2: Pull SQL tables into Python Step3: Clean data in Python Step4: Perform Exploratory Data Analysis Step5: Plot and Visualize Data

Conclusion: Since most New Yorkers work from 9am to 5pm EST, there is potential for Yolocal Snack to fill in their hunger and thirst needs. My analysis and visualizations will reveal which stations within each borough receive the most commuters on weekdays,determine whether or not most New Yorkers commute during meal hours and present a rough estimate of how long commutes take for commuters within stations.
