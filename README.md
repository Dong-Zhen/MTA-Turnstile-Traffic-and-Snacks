# MTA-Turnstile-Traffic-and-Snacks

# Abstract

For my mta turnstile project I reached to a non-existant nonprofit company called Yolocal Snack. They sell affordable traveler snacks supplied by the local food community to New York City commuters. Yolocal Snack aims to help local food communities make revenue and make commuters happy by solving their energy and hunger problems. According to [geotab](https://www.geotab.com/time-to-commute/), 90% of NYC residents' commute take longer than 1 hour. A lot can change for commuters emotionaly and physically within that time frame especially if they were in a rush to get to their destinations during meal hours and missed their meals. My job as their analysis is to use public mta turnstile data to find where long distance commuters are traveling during common meal hours.

# Design 

Based of popular happy hour and breakfast times, I set the common meal hours for morning entry to be 8am - 12pm and evening exits to be 4pm - 8pm. Then I defined a commuter as a nine to five worker or student who goes to a different location on weekdays.

To: YoLocal Snack Executives, Rita and Leon

I visited your store last week and picked up a vegetable snack bag. I really enjoyed the sweet potato hashbrowns inside, it gave me the energy to work through the morning. Due to that experience and my desire to help the community, I want to contribute towards Yolocal Snack's vision of energizing commuters with locally made traveler snacks. With my data science background, I could prepare a report for you by the end of next week that will help you identify the top stations where New Yorkers with long commutes exit and enter from. Within the report, you can also find visualizations of four-hour-time windows when you could expect a rush of people leaving or entering those stations. These insights could help Yolocal Snack find new locations to open shops and better prepare for higher demands during certain time frames. I attached a project proposal in the email, please let me know if you are interested and if you have any questions. Looking forward to hearing back from the team.
